# personal Loan Classification Project
In this project, we aim to solve the problem of classifying personal loans on the Thera-Bank dataset. The majority of Thera-Bank's customers are depositors, and the number of asset customers (customers who are also borrowers) is quite small. The bank is interested in expanding this base quickly to do more loan business while earning more through loan interest.

The bank wants to convert its liability customers into retail loan customers while keeping them as depositors. A campaign run by the bank last year for deposit customers showed a conversion rate of over 9.6% success. This success has prompted the retail marketing department to develop campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success rate with a minimal budget.

To achieve this goal, the department would like to develop a classifier that can help them identify potential customers who are more likely to purchase the loan. This will increase the success rate while reducing the cost of the campaign.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Bank_Loan_modelling whitch can download from (this link)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itsmesunil/bank-loan-modelling], which contains information about customers who have applied for loans. The dataset has the following features:

ID: Customer ID
Age: Customer's age
Experience: Number of years of professional experience
Income: Annual income of the customer
ZIP Code: Home address ZIP code of the customer
Family: Number of family members
CCAvg: Average credit card spending per month
Education: Education level of the customer (1: Undergrad, 2: Graduate, 3: Advanced/Professional)
Mortgage: Value of house mortgage if any
Personal Loan: Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last campaign? (1: Yes, 0: No)
Securities Account: Does the customer have a securities account with the bank? (1: Yes, 0: No)
CD Account: Does the customer have a certificate of deposit (CD) account with the bank? (1: Yes, 0: No)
Online: Does the customer use internet banking? (1: Yes, 0: No)
CreditCard: Does the customer have a credit card with the bank? (1: Yes, 0: No)
Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a classifier that can predict whether a customer is likely to accept the personal loan offered by the bank. This will help the retail marketing department to target potential customers more effectively, thus increasing the success rate while reducing the cost of the campaign.
